# DragDropLayouts

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/parttio/dragdroplayouts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/parttio/dragdroplayouts) 

Currently when you want to drag and drop between layouts you will have to wrap the source component in a DragAndDropWrapper. 
Many times this is adequate but it tends to add some complexity to the code and yet another element in the DOM. It would 
be much nicer if the layouts would handle this for you.

To solve this issue I have extended the core layouts and implemented the necessary functionality so the layouts are valid 
drag sources and drop targets. This means that in your code you don't have to concern yourself with the drag and drop when 
adding components, only enable drag&drop in the layout and you are ready to go!

A running demo can be found [here](http://apps-johndevs.rhcloud.com/dragdroplayouts)

## Branches

Currently there are two active development streams; one for Framework 7 and another one for Framework 8. Pull-requests that target the Framework 7 stream should be created against the [vaadin7 branch](/github/parttio/tree/vaadin7). Changes for the Framework 8 version can be created for [master](/github/parttio/tree/master) as usual. Note that changes that fix an issue in both versions need two PR's respectively.
